B01070FUDE,"Doctor said, ""Your arteries look like Pennsylvania highways in spring...clogged with non-working construction crews and pretty much impassable. So you might wanna try this first and then we'll start blasting."" Well, not blasting exactly, but...I tried a different fish oil and decided it would be easier to hook up a pissed-off Angus bull to a milking machine than get this thing to go down my throat. Hubby suggested I try something smaller (that's a change in tack) and I ordered these. I spent five minutes actually sniffing the bottle and trying to figure out if they'd mislabeled a bottle of baking ingredients. It smells just like vanilla! It was also about a third of the size of the horse pill I'd been trying to swallow. It's only been a few days, but at least now my Doc might not have to break out the C4.",Smells like vanilla?,Reviewed in the United States on 8 September 2023,True,5.0

B01070FUDE,I‚Äôm on accutane right now and a side effect is a lot of joint pain. I noticed immediately when I don‚Äôt take these pills the pain is worse. They clearly work and it doesn‚Äôt give me gross fish burps. The only downside with these pills is the lowest recommended dose for an adult is 1000mg to 1200mg so you have to take about 3-4 pills a day. I think it can get expensive in the long run so I found a cheaper version at sams club. I am actually finding that the best dose is 2000-3000 mg. So definitely find something cheaper with more mg.,Great but too expensive,Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2023,True,4.0

B01070FUDE,"I bought these pills because I heard fish oil is best for joint/tissue discomfort. I have a torn rotator cuff that I refuse to get surgery on but it seems like the pain multiplies for each year that I let it go untreated. I hate surgeries and have had friends who have had surgery on their rotator cuff only to find out that it didn‚Äôt work and the pain is worse. So yeah no surgery for me and I‚Äôm also hesitant to get steroid shots for the pain. As per custom when I am baffled or need more info then I go to Google. I read up a lot about my torn rotator cuff and found out that fish oil was a good option and that Krill was even more beneficial. The next step was to order from Amazon.  I have taken fish oil supplements in the past but like other customers have noted that they are huge and hard to swallow and they leave a fishy after taste. After reading many many reviews I decided to purchase this brand of Krill softgels.I have been taking these tablets for over a month and they work. Yes, at almost $40 a bottle it MAY appear that this is pricier than most but it is NOT considering that you have almost a 4 month supply. The pills are tiny in comparison to other fish oils and YES they smell like vanilla. They are easy to swallow and there is no aftertaste. I was kind of nervous taking these because after a week my symptoms were still there. I said to myself ‚Äúbe patient, you can‚Äôt expect a miracle overnight‚Äù but the problem was that yes... I was expecting this to work fast. After a few good talks with myself I decided to give these pills a chance. In other words I would finish the bottle before posting a review. Funny thing though, about 5 weeks after taking these pills I noticed that the constant pain in my cuff has lessened to almost nothing. I know that these pills are not the cure but I really wanted something to lessen the pain and it did. Ironically I experienced more pain during my sleep because I throw my arms above my head when I sleep. I also move a lot in my sleep. So I felt pain in my right shoulder cuff and lots of soreness during the day as well. As I stated earlier these soft gels are not a cure but they are a good preventative measure and they have lessen my daily pain so yeah I love them.",Helps Me With Torn Rotator Cuff Pain - Yay üòÄ,Reviewed in the United States on 1 December 2020,True,5.0

B01070FUDE,"I have a weird reaction to most fish oil supplements. Usually whenever I take those large pills, my skin breaks out with deep cystic acne, although that seems counterintuitive due to fish oil‚Äôs anti-inflammatory effects. I have had this reaction to fish oil pills my entire life. This brand is the only fish oil brand that actually helps my skin and doesn‚Äôt cause breakouts. It‚Äôs also very easy to swallow.I recently ran out of my last bottle of MegaRed, so I tried another brand that my doctor gave me. Within a few days, I developed 3 cystic acne lesions on my face (one on my temple, cheek, and neck). I have not have any problems with acne in a few years until now. I immediately ceased taking those supplements and ordered another bottle of this one. Bonus: these are much easier to swallow.Highly recommend.For the record, I am a 48 year old woman.",The only fish oil I can use,Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2023,True,5.0

B01070FUDE,"I suddenly began to experiencing horrible depression, anxiety, and insomnia.  Talked to my doctor, therapist, and even a psychiatrist. Blamed the side effects on recently prescribed medication I only took for 2 days but even after I stopped they didn't go away.. A week later and I'm sitting here thinking any am I still feeling ""off""... Then it hit me... A couple weeks ago, I decided to replace my fish oil with krill oil after hearing about all of the positive effects. BAD IDEA!!These are all of the side effects I ended up with:Agitation: In some cases, the krill oil supplementation may elevate levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the brain. This enhances neurotransmission and can result in increased energy levels. While the increased energy may seem beneficial, it can sometimes manifest as agitation, making it difficult to function.Anxiety: While some purport that one of krill oil‚Äôs benefits is its ability to reduce anxiety, others end up experiencing increased anxiety from supplementation. If you experience an increase in anxiety, it‚Äôs likely a result of the omega-3s within the oil that over-activate brain activity and certain neural pathways.Bloating: Many people notice that after they take their daily supply of krill oil, they begin to feel bloated. Bloating is a common side effect of krill oil supplementation and one that most people are willing to put up with. If the bloating is severe, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to stop taking the krill. For most people, the bloating occurs on a random basis and is pretty easy to tolerate.Burping: Another extremely common side effect associated with krill oil is that of ‚Äúburps.‚Äù We‚Äôve all had cases of burping after swallowing any type of oil, and it can be unpleasant. You may notice the resurfacing of a krill taste in your mouth with each consecutive burp. Most people aren‚Äôt too bothered by this, but if it‚Äôs a problem, you could switch to a different krill supplier with an alternative encapsulation modality; this may reduce the burping.Depression: Despite the fact that many people claim krill oil helps improve their mood, others have found that krill oil actually amplifies their depression. This may be a result of increasing brain activity in certain areas and/or the omega-3 fatty acid contents altering neurotransmitter levels and efficiency. If you notice yourself becoming increasingly depressed after supplementation, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to discontinue.Gas: Have you noticed an increase in flatulence after you started taking krill oil? Many people notice that it disrupts their digestion and can result in constipation, indigestion, and ultimately the passing of gas. This isn‚Äôt the worst side effect, but may feel uncomfortable if it persists.Heartburn: Some people have complained about heartburn associated with krill oil supplementation. One suggested solution to avoid the side effect of heartburn is to take krill oil with a full meal. If the heartburn becomes difficult to deal with, try reducing your dose or discontinuing for awhile.Insomnia: The omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) within krill oil can significantly bolster energy levels and brain activity. Dopamine levels may increase and brain activity may become quicker ‚Äì both of which may contribute to insomnia. If you‚Äôve found it difficult to sleep at night due to racing thoughts before bed, it may be worth stopping the krill oil.Nausea: Feeling nauseous as a result of krill oil supplementation is a sign that you may have taken a rancid batch, an allergic reaction, or that you‚Äôre unable to tolerate it. Nausea is generally a warning sign that a foreign substance is incompatible with your physiological homeostasis.Sleep disturbances: Some people notice a stimulating effect from supplementation of krill oil. This is likely a result of the omega-3 content, but the phospholipids and astaxanthin may also contribute to enhancing this effect. The increase in neurotransmitters and efficiency of neurotransmission can result in sleep difficulties such as insomnia, which stem from anxiety.Dizziness: If you become dizzy or experience vertigo from krill oil, it could be a bad batch, or it could be that you just don‚Äôt tolerate it. This is another sign of an allergic reaction, but could also stem from the influx of omega-3 fatty acids. As the brain adapts to the increase in omega-3s, neurotransmission or neural pathways may become altered; making you dizzy.",DO NOT TAKE UNTIL YOU TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR!!,Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2022,True,1.0
