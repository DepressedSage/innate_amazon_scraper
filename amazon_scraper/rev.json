I should be totally clear of it in about another week. Don't think I tried to get back to normal without medicine. I've been using Imodium  and it is working. I thought it might be just me so my girlfriend, who is an RN, tried it once and started having gas problems. So it's not just me. I do not wish this on anyone else.
